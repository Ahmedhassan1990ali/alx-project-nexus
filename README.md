# **ProDev Backend Engineering Program – Overview**

The **ProDev Backend Engineering Program** is designed to prepare developers for professional backend roles by combining foundational skills with advanced practices. It emphasizes hands-on projects, collaboration, and real-world problem-solving to build production-ready systems.

## **ProDev Backend Engineering – Major Learnings**

### **Core Python Foundations**

* Querying Power and Iterators
* **Python Generators** for efficient data pipelines
* **Python Decorators** for cross-cutting concerns (logging, caching, etc.)
* **Context Managers** (`with` statements) and **Asynchronous Programming** (`async/await`, `asyncio`)

### **Software Quality and Testing**

* Unit Testing and Integration Testing
* Test automation using **Unittest**
* Mocking external services and fixtures
* CI/CD test pipelines for continuous validation

### **Web Development with Django**

* Building robust REST APIs using **Django REST Framework (DRF)**
* Authentication and Permissions (TokenAuth, JWT, OAuth2)
* Middleware: custom logging, request validation, and monitoring
* Event Listeners (signals) and ORM optimization (querysets, indexing)
* **Caching in Django** (per-view, per-template, Redis-backed)
* Analytics integration (logging, monitoring, reporting)

### **System Tools and Shell Proficiency**

* Linux Shell Basics (navigation, file manipulation, processes)
* Advanced Shell Scripting (automation, cron jobs, pipelines)

### **Collaboration and Version Control**

* Git Basics and Advanced Branching Strategies
* **Git-Flows** for professional collaboration (feature branches, pull requests, releases)

### **DevOps and Deployment**

* **Containerization with Docker** (Dockerfile, docker-compose)
* **Container Orchestration with Kubernetes** (scaling, load balancing, secrets)
* CI/CD with **Jenkins** and **GitHub Actions** (build, test, deploy pipelines)
* Environment variable management with `.env` files

### **Modern API Patterns**

* REST APIs with DRF (serializers, viewsets, pagination, throttling)
* **GraphQL** (schema design, queries, mutations, resolvers)

### **Scheduling and Automation**

* Background tasks with **Celery** and **Redis**
* Scheduled jobs with **cron** and Celery beat
* Automation pipelines for data ingestion and reporting

## **Challenges Faced and Solutions Implemented**

* The journey was a bit intense and sometimes the tasks was tough but with collaborating and encouraging each other, we could go through
---

## **Best Practices & Personal Takeaways**

* **Documentation**: API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI is vital for collaboration.
* **DevOps Awareness**: Understanding Docker and CI/CD pipelines makes you production-ready.
* **Problem-Solving Approach**: Break down complex backend tasks into smaller components.
* **Team Collaboration**: Using Git branching strategies (Git Flow, PR reviews) fosters professional habits.
